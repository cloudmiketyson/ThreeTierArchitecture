## Setting Up the Infrastructure

Follow these steps to set up the infrastructure using Terraform:

1. **Create Backend Bucket:**
    - Change directory into the "s3-bucket" directory to create the backend bucket.

    ```bash
    cd s3-bucket
    ```

2. **Update Backend Configuration:**
    - Change directory into the "three-tier-architecture" directory.
    - Update the `backend.tf` file with the necessary configurations.

    ```bash
    cd three-tier-architecture
    # Edit backend.tf with your preferred text editor
    ```

3. **Run Terraform Commands:**
    - Run Terraform commands to create the infrastructure.

    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

Follow these steps in sequence to ensure a smooth setup of the three-tier architecture. Make sure to review the Terraform scripts and configurations before applying them to your environment.
